# 📊 US Debt Tracker Project

This project analyzes and visualizes the trends, patterns, and projections of US public debt. It was created using Excel and includes narrative explanations, charts, and a forecast model. It answers three key questions about debt growth, seasonal trends, and future projections.

## 📌 Project Objective

To help a small debt agency analyze US public and intragovernmental debt based on historical data. The final deliverable answers key questions posed by the US Government using charts, tables, and clear summaries.

## 📈 Key Insights

### 1. Yearly Debt Percentage Increase
- Debt increased steadily between 2013–2019, with a major spike in 2020 due to COVID-19 spending.
- Public debt is the main driver of total debt changes year-over-year.

### 2. Monthly Debt Trends
- January and December consistently show the highest debt levels.
- Lowest debt occurs around April and May, likely due to tax collection inflows.

### 3. Projected Debt Growth (2023–2027)
- Publicly held debt is forecasted to rise from $24.5 trillion in 2022 to over $33 trillion by 2027.
- This suggests aggressive borrowing unless spending patterns shift.

## 💡 Recommendations

Recommendations:
- Control Government Spending - Focus on reducing wasteful spending and improving efficiency in big programs like defense, healthcare, and infrastructure.

- Increase Revenue Responsibly - Close tax loopholes, improve tax collection, and consider fair tax reforms that don’t hurt middle- and low-income earners.

- Encourage Economic Growth - Invest in education, technology, and small businesses to grow the economy — a stronger economy means more tax revenue without raising rates.

- Limit Emergency Borrowing - Create reserve funds during good years, so the government doesn’t have to borrow as much during crises.

- Set Clear Fiscal Targets - Use budget rules or debt ceilings that encourage long-term planning and accountability in both Congress and federal agencies.

- Bipartisan Action - Encourage cooperation between political parties to pass meaningful and lasting debt solutions, not just short-term fixes.
